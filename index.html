    <p class="myP" >My name is Aniruddh Chittabathini and I am a third-year Finance and Information Systems students at The Ohio State University Fisher College of Business. I am part of the Integrated Business and Engineering Honors Program where I am minoring in Engineering in addition to minoring in Business Analytics. In High School, I have worked closely with several different teams, including a Robotics Team that went to world championships and a Science Olympiad Team that went to Nationals every year. While attending university, I work with a Facility Operations Management Team for an athletics facility and for a non-profit organization called Ascent Microfinance as a Marketing Director. Using these experiences as a backbone for success, I applied for a summer internship as a freshmen at the Indian School of Business, which is the number 1 business school in India. I conducted research on how to minimalize the risk of bank runs happening around the world. </p>
